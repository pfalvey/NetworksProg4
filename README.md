Patrick:
need to keep track of users and passwords in server. store in file in server. When server starts read this file and use a map. When client starts, have it send user name to server and have server request password.

Mikey:
define protocol: P for private, B for broadcast, E for exit.
have client send P B or E. Server prompts user for message or username if it is private message.

Matt:
extend multithreading so server can keep track of all the clients.
add another thread to client to receive the messages. 
(and then help out mikey and pat)
